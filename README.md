### [NameDays](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/latvie%C5%A1u-v%C4%81rdadienas/id6477299991)
The "NameDays" project is a SwiftUI-based iOS application designed to celebrate name days, a tradition in various cultures where each day of the year is associated with specific names. This app aims to keep users informed about name days, offering functionalities to enhance their experience in celebrating these special occasions.

### Core Features

- **Today's Name Days**: Displays the list of names celebrating their name day on the current date, providing users with immediate access to today's celebrations.
- **Upcoming Name Days**: Offers a preview of name days in the near future, helping users prepare for upcoming celebrations.
- **Notification System**: Utilizes iOS notifications to remind users about important name days, ensuring they don't miss out on celebrating their own or their loved ones' name days.
- **Data Management**: The app loads and displays name day data from a JSON file, showcasing the ability to manage and present data within a SwiftUI application.
- **User Customization**: Allows users to set their preferences for notification times and choose the types of notifications they wish to receive, making the app adaptable to individual needs.

### Technical Highlights

- **SwiftUI Framework**: Leverages SwiftUI for the user interface development, employing state management, navigation, and layout capabilities to create a modern and efficient user experience.
- **Local and Push Notifications**: Implements `UNUserNotificationCenter` for managing local notifications, with the potential to extend functionality to include push notifications for real-time updates.
- **JSON Data Parsing**: Demonstrates handling and parsing JSON data, enabling the app to load and utilize local data for displaying name days.
- **App Lifecycle Adaptation**: Incorporates SwiftUI app lifecycle events for initializing and updating the app's notification system and data, ensuring the application is responsive and up-to-date.

### Objective

The primary goal of the "NameDays" app is to connect users with cultural traditions through technology, offering a convenient and engaging platform for celebrating name days. By combining a user-friendly design with effective notification and data management features, the app provides a personalized experience for recognizing and participating in name day celebrations.
